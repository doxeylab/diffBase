- Still some hyphens leftover in sequences, remember to clean these out when I
  get new versions of sequences
- Need to implement a sequence update script
- Show all rows in blast results table (requires custom javascript; worthwhile?)
- Repo needs a licence
- Think about modularizing the app a bit more.. it's kind of annoying to have
  to retype everything twice
